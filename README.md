# Hello to new framework

# IMPORTANT

to install into a test repo, run `python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` and then there should be a `dist` folder in which there is a whl file similar to `/Users/shahdivyank/Desktop/dotcom/dist/dotcom-0.1.4-py3-none-any.whl` with which u can install. simply do `pip install /Users/shahdivyank/Desktop/dotcom/dist/dotcom-0.1.4-py3-none-any.whl --force-reinstall` (u need the force reinstall so you dont have to update the version number each time)
